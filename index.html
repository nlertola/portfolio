  <p>Hello. My name is Nick. If I had time to make an awesome portfolio, I would.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, I do not</p>
  <p>This is my best work</p>
  <p>
    Email me: <a href="mailto:nlertola@live.com">at my email</a>
    and check out some of my sweet projects:

      <a href="https://resumebuddy.ai" target="_blank">Resume Buddy</a> is a service used for 
      storing all of your professional experience. My algorithm will build a 
      resume based on a job description and your most closely correlated experience 
      bullet points. As a bonus I incorporated GPT-4 support to rewrite or "professionalize"
      your bullet points and write cover letters for you using your own experiences. You can 
      also practice with a mock interview tailored to a specific job position.

      <a href="https://qmot.tv" target="_blank">Quote Me On That</a> is a real time group game played 
      by hosting a game on one monitor (<a href="https://qmot.tv/host" target="_blank">use this link to host a new game</a>)
      and having each participant join the game on their phone/laptops. Each player is given a prompt 
      to answer and each round a selected "critic" will vote on which response they find the funniest.
      This game is best played in groups of 4-10 people.

      <a href="https://intinker.com" target="_blank">Intinker</a> is a 3D printer optimization
      company which I co-founded in 2020 (left in 2022). We created an iterative printing and scoring system 
      and utilized ML to decide new and better slicer settings for your specific printer each print.
      I wrote the web application, interfacing for the ML algorithm, and database design/creation.
